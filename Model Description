# IMRT and VMAT Decision Support Tool

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a regression model-based decision support tool designed to assist clinicians in choosing between Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) and Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) for treating thoracic esophageal cancer.

## Tool Description

The decision support tool uses logistic regression models (P1 and P2) to predict the likelihood of plan compliance for IMRT and VMAT techniques. Key features used in the models include:

- **PTV Volume**: The volume of the Planning Target Volume (PTV).
- **Total Lung Volume (TLV)**: The total volume of the lungs.
- **TLV/PTV Ratio**: The ratio of Total Lung Volume to PTV volume.
- **THV/PTV Ratio**: The ratio of Total Heart Volume to PTV volume.
- **PTV Length**: The length of the PTV.

## Model Implementation

The models were developed using Varian Eclipse TPS and have been validated with clinical data. The implementation details are as follows:

- **Data Collection**: The clinical data was collected from patients undergoing radiotherapy for thoracic esophageal cancer.
- **Model Training**: Logistic regression models were trained to predict the likelihood of plan compliance.
- **Model Evaluation**: The models were evaluated using metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC).

## Usage

Clinicians can use this tool to:

1. **Select the Optimal Technique**: The tool predicts whether IMRT or VMAT would be more compliant based on patient-specific parameters.
2. **Assess Plan Compliance**: It provides an early assessment of plan compliance likelihood, allowing for adjustments before the final plan is executed.

## Access and Contributions

The decision support tool is publicly accessible and can be found at [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Huangshan2164/IMRT_VMAT_Decision_Support_Tool). Contributions to the tool are welcome. Please follow the contribution guidelines provided in the repository.

## Future Work

Future research will focus on refining the models, expanding validation efforts, and integrating additional predictive factors to enhance model accuracy and clinical applicability.
